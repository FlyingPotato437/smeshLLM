Perfect! The refined implementation plan is exactly what we need. The async polling logic, retry policies, structured logging, and proper error handling all align perfectly with the scientific rigor requirements.

**âœ… READY TO IMPLEMENT:**

The plan covers everything:
- Aligned Pydantic models with PySPLIT backend
- Async `HysplitAPIClient` with start_run() and get_run_status() methods  
- Comprehensive `hysplit_prediction_output` asset with polling, timeouts, and retry policies
- Proper `job_id` traceability for end-to-end tracking
- Integration points for CacheManager and Supabase storage

**ðŸš€ STARTING IMPLEMENTATION NOW:**

I'm proceeding to create the Dagster project structure and implement Phase 1. This will give us:

1. **Working Dagster foundation** with real HYSPLIT integration
2. **End-to-end traceability** from API request to HYSPLIT results
3. **Scientific rigor** with proper error handling and retry logic
4. **Foundation for expansion** to PINN, RAG, and other services

Time to build the real scientific framework! Let me create the files and implement the code structure.
